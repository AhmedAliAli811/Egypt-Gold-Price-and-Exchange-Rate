# Egypt Gold Price and Exchange Rate for Dollar and Euro


This project is an exploration of the relationship between gold prices and exchange rates for USD and EUR against the Egyptian Pound, using principles from the book *Storytelling with Data* to craft clear and insightful visualizations. I retrieved real-time gold price data through web scraping and sourced exchange rates from the Central Bank of Egypt. 

The primary goal is to applying key concepts from *Storytelling with Data*, such as context, clarity, and simplicity, I demonstrate how to present data in a way that is both informative and accessible.

## Project Highlights

- **Web Scraping for Real-Time Data**: I used web scraping techniques to fetch up-to-date gold price data, ensuring the analysis reflects the most current market conditions.
- **Exchange Rates Integration**: I collected USD and EUR exchange rates from the Central Bank of Egypt and integrated them with gold price data to analyze trends and correlations between currency values and gold prices.
- **Standardization for Comparison**: Since gold prices and exchange rates have different scales, I performed standardization on the prices to ensure a fair comparison. This allows for meaningful insights when comparing the relative movements of gold prices and currencies.
- **Data Transformation with Power Query**: In Power Query, I cleaned and transformed the data to ensure consistency and accuracy, preparing it for further analysis.
- **Storytelling through Visualizations**: Following the *Storytelling with Data* philosophy, I created simple and clear visualizations to highlight key insights, focusing on clarity and minimizing clutter.


## Concepts Applied from *Storytelling with Data*

- **Data at a Glance**: I designed the dashboard to provide a clear and concise overview of the current exchange rates for the US dollar, Euro, and 24-karat gold against the Egyptian Pound. The current values for each currency are highlighted, making the information easy to understand at a glance.
  
- **Visual Comparison**: I used a line chart to compare the historical trends of the dollar, Euro, and gold prices against the Egyptian Pound. Different line colors make the chart easy to read and distinguish between the three currencies. Axis labels and gridlines provide the necessary context for interpretation.

- **Clear Labeling**: I ensured the chart is labeled with clear and concise titles, including the date, currency names, and the overall title "مؤشر الدولار واليورو والذهب عيار 24 بالنسبة للجنيه المصري" (Index of Dollar, Euro, and 24-karat Gold against the Egyptian Pound). This labeling makes it easy for the audience to understand the content and purpose of the visualization.

## Key Features

- **Applying Storytelling with Data**: I applied the principles of context, clarity, and simplicity to design effective visualizations that guide the viewer’s attention to the key messages.
- **Gold Price Data**: I scraped real-time gold prices, allowing for analysis of recent trends in the gold market.
- **Standardization for Comparison**: I standardized the gold prices and exchange rates to make them comparable on the same scale, enabling a fair comparison of trends.
- **Power Query for Data Cleaning**: I used Power Query to transform raw data into a clean, structured format suitable for analysis.


## Tools Used

- **Power Query**: For transforming and cleaning the data.
- **Power BI**: To create dynamic and interactive visualizations.


## Objective

The goal of this project was to analyze gold and currency exchange data while applying data visualization techniques from *Storytelling with Data*. By simplifying and clearly presenting the findings, this project demonstrates the power of effective data storytelling in making complex financial data accessible and meaningful.
